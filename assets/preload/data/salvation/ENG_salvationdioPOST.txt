:touka-post:How much longer do we have to wait? We told her the truth and that should've activated the rumor right?
:nemu-post:The rumor is back.
:touka-post:Finally, some good news! lets get started and rally up the feathers.
:nemu-post:Actually, that is bad news.
:touka-post:...?
:nemu-post:Someone seperated the rumor from the hostess, we're still missing a Maiden.
:touka-post:Ugghh! Are you telling those little imbeciles at the subway removed our brainwashing!?
:touka-post:I thought our hostess had a faint heart and couldn't be easily broken.
:nemu-post:She does, someone must of have had the magic to remove it and calm her down.
:alina-post:And you had to tell the hostess out hideout?
:touka-post:How would I know that this would happen!
:alina-post:I'll send over some feathers to watch over them and report anything valuable.
:touka-post:Make sure they don't ever lose sight on the one who tampered our hostess.
:alina-post:I don't want any news of that boy I'll direct the feathers to you. He is already a nusiance to look at.
